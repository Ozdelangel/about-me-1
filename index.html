    <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <h2>Bio</h2>   
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am originally from a small border town in Arizona called Yuma, and proud of it! I love the desert. I have been married for four years to my wife, Taylor. We are expecting our first child in February.
        </li>
      </ul> 
      <br>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I attended college at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I always planned on being an active duty Army officer, so I chose history as a major because it aligned with my interests and would allow me to quickly begin my Army career.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I worked as a Pricing Analyst at Zillow Offers, then moved into an analytical/account management role in Renovations. I also have worked as an light infantry and mechanized infantry platoon leader in the SC and AZ Army National Guard.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I want to become a software engineer at Zillow. Eventually, I would like to experience more of what the software engineering world has to offer, such as roles in product management or life at a startup.
